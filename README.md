This Project is a fullstack project that calls a python script that edits a configuration.yaml file with values entered by a user using a React Frontend. 
For example, the user is able to change the alarm code, arming time, delay time, trigger time, etc... through the frontend, and using express and a backend node server, we call the python script to change the config file with the new values entered by the user.
